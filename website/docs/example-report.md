# Study Protocol
Last edited: June 11th, 2024

## Variables to be Collected
- Muscle Data
   - EMG measurements
   - MMG measurements
- Survey data
- Step count

### Muscle Data Measurement

Timing? -> in the morning?! (most consistent?)

### EMG + MMG Measurement Protocol

1. Clean skin where the electrodes will be positioned
2. Position measurement electrodes as in [Smith et al 2017](https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.25502) - see drawing
<img src="vastus-lateralis-muscle.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
3. Start protocol time tracker
4. Sit down on the floor, against a wall, legs straight
5. Keep muscles relaxed, start measurement (10s)
6. Try to maximally contract your upper leg muscles as much as possible for 3 x  6s (see also [Hendrix et al (2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027009002015))
7. Stand up and take wall sit position, 90 degree angle (30s) (this is a form of isometric muscle contraction and according to [Li et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1145/3648679), this is the type of exercise most often used in fatigure detection based on EMG; also wall sit is an [exercise that engages the vastus lateralis](https://www.yourhousefitness.com/blog/exercise-tutorial-wall-sit#google_vignette); similarly [Gawda et al 2018](https://www.aaem.pl/pdf-81716-26429?filename=Differences%20in.pdf) ask runners to perform 60s squats to measure fatigue)
8. Sit down again, back agains the wall, legs straight (10s)


### Survey
#### Questions from first trial
- How fatigued were you today? 1 (no fatigue at all) to 7 (extremely fatigued)
- Symptoms experienced today 
   - Muscle weakness
   - Trouble climbing stairs
   - Trouble standing from a seated position
   - Active Rash
   - Brain Fog
   - Extreme Fatigue
- How difficult was it to dress and shower today? 1 (no difficulty) to 5 (unable to do).
- How difficult was it to climb stairs today? 1 (no difficulty) to 5 (unable to do).
- <span style="color:red">How difficult was it to complete common daily activities?  1 (no difficulty) to 5 (unable to do). [Kick Out - high correlation with pain] </span>
- How much pain were you in today? 1 (pain at all) to 5 (worst pain experienced).
- Do you have an active and visible rash? 1 (no rash at all) to 5 (very visible rash in DM areas)
- Overall how did you feel today? As an overall "wellness" 1 (horrible, hard to function) to 5 (very well).[Kick Out - high correlation with pain]
- How do you think you will feel tomorrow? As an overall "wellness" 1 (horrible, hard to function) to 5 (very well).
